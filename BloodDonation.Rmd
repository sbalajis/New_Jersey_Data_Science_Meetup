### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

### Set working directory here.
```{r, include=TRUE}
setwd("C:/R/Kaggle ToolSet/WIP")
```

### One way to Load the data is through file explorer
```{r}
# transFusionData <- read.csv(file.choose()) 
```

### Here we use Read the CSV File
```{r, include=TRUE}
transFusionData <- read.csv("transfusion.data")  
# sep = ";" (if separated by Colon) - lot of options for this command, Refer Help.
```

## Attribute Information:

Given is the variable name, variable type, the measurement unit and a brief description. The "Blood Transfusion Service Center" is a classification problem. The order of this listing corresponds to the order of numerals along the rows of the database. 

R (Recency - months since last donation), 
F (Frequency - total number of donation), 
M (Monetary - total blood donated in c.c.), 
T (Time - months since first donation), and 
a binary variable representing whether he/she donated blood in March 2007 (1 stand for donating blood; 0 stands for not donating blood). 


### Now that you have read the file, do basic analysis - ensure the file has been read correctly
```{r, include=TRUE}
head(transFusionData)
tail(transFusionData)
colnames(transFusionData)
str(transFusionData)
```

### Read the content as data frame
```{r, include=TRUE}
df <- data.frame(transFusionData)
```

### Now that you have assigned the dataframe, Confirm the assignment, do basic analysis
```{r, include=TRUE}
head(df)
str(df)
```

### Find out if any column value is missing.
```{r, include=TRUE}
anyNA(df)
```
False means there is nothing missing

### Change the column names to be meaningful and easy to manage
```{r, include=TRUE}
cols <- c("MthsElapsedSinceLast","TimesDonated","VolumeDonated","MthsElapsedSinceFirst", "DonatedInMar07")
colnames(df) <- cols
# Ensure the names were changed.
str(df)
```

### Include the GGPlot2 Library.
```{r, include=TRUE}
#if (!require('ggplot2')) install.packages('ggplot2'); library('ggplot2')
library(ggplot2)
```

### Now that we have confirmed all the data, let us proceed to GGPlot 
```{r, include=TRUE}
pl1 <- ggplot(data=df, aes(x=DonatedInMar07, y=TimesDonated))
pl1 + geom_point()
```

>=====================================================================================
>Inference: The donation level drops after people have donated more than 25 times. 
>Also, Those who donated higher than 25 times, seems to be regular donars.
>=====================================================================================

```{r, include=TRUE}
pl1 <- ggplot(data=df, aes(x=DonatedInMar07, y=VolumeDonated))
pl1 + geom_point()
```

>=====================================================================================
>Inference: The donation volumne is generally below 6250 CC.
>Also, Those who donated higher than 30 times, seems to be donating higher amount of volume.
>=====================================================================================

```{r, include=TRUE}
pl1 <- ggplot(data=df, aes(x=DonatedInMar07, y=MthsElapsedSinceLast))
pl1 + geom_point()
```

>=====================================================================================
>Inference: If the Months elasped since the last donation is less than 30, people donate more.
>If the months elasped is greater than 30, they lose interest and very few people give blood.
>=====================================================================================

```{r, include=TRUE}
pl1 <- ggplot(data=df, aes(x=DonatedInMar07, y=MthsElapsedSinceFirst))
pl1 + geom_point()
```

>=====================================================================================
>Inference: The Months elasped since the First Months does not seems to be a good indicator.
>The predictor seems to be distributed evenly with Donors & non-donors. We should try this
>predictor with other predictors to get more insights.
>=====================================================================================


## Histogram
```{r, include=TRUE}
hist1 <- ggplot(data=df, aes(x=MthsElapsedSinceLast)) + geom_histogram()
print(hist1)
```

>=======================================================================================
>Inference: Here The Months elasped since the Last donation shows significant drop in count
>after 30 months. Which is consistent with other observations.  
>=====================================================================================

```{r, include=TRUE}
hist1 <- ggplot(data=df, aes(x=MthsElapsedSinceFirst)) + geom_histogram()
print(hist1)
```


```{r, include=TRUE}
hist1 <- ggplot(data=df, aes(x=TimesDonated)) + geom_histogram()
print(hist1)
```


## Scatter plots 
```{r, include=TRUE}
Splot1 = ggplot(data=df, aes(x=TimesDonated, y=MthsElapsedSinceFirst))
Splot1 + geom_point()
# Something like Bubble Graph 
Splot1 + geom_point(aes(size=TimesDonated))

# Now color by cylinder - Useful for segmentation
Splot1 + geom_point(aes(size=TimesDonated, color=factor(DonatedInMar07)))
```

>=====================================================================================
>Inference: If the MonthsElapsedSinceFirst >= 12 and TimeDonated <= 10, the liklihood of
>Non Donated is significantly high.
>Also If the MonthsElapsedSinceFirst >= 25 and TimesDonated >- 10, the liklihood of Donated is 
>significantly high. We can consider this as new factors. 

>Just a caution: May be overfitting?
>=====================================================================================

## Bar Plots
```{r, include=TRUE}
bplot1 <- ggplot(df, aes(x=MthsElapsedSinceLast))
bplot1 + geom_bar()

bplot1 + geom_bar(aes(fill=factor(DonatedInMar07)))
bplot1 + geom_bar(aes(fill=factor(DonatedInMar07)), position='dodge')  
bplot1 + geom_bar(aes(fill=factor(DonatedInMar07)), position='fill')  
```

>=====================================================================================
>Inference: If the MonthsElapsedSinceLast >= 5 the liklihood of Non Donated is significantly high.
>=====================================================================================

## Box Plots
```{r, include=TRUE}
boxplot1 <- ggplot(df, aes(x=factor(DonatedInMar07), y=MthsElapsedSinceLast))
print(boxplot1 + geom_boxplot())
# We can add color
boxplot1 + geom_boxplot(aes(fill=factor(DonatedInMar07)))
```

### Grab only numeric columns
```{r, include=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(dplyr)

num.cols <- sapply(df, is.numeric)

# Filter to numeric columns for correlation
cor.data <- cor(df[,num.cols])

cor.data

library(corrplot)
library(corrgram)

# Usual Correlation plot.c
corrplot(cor.data,method='color')

# one more variation of Correlation Plot
corrgram(df,order=TRUE, lower.panel=panel.shade, upper.panel=panel.pie, text.panel=panel.txt)
```
  

### Splitting Dataset into Training and Test Datasets.
```{r, include=TRUE}
# Import Library
library(caTools)
# Set a random see so your "random" results are the same as this notebook
set.seed(101) 

# It is better to split the dataset on the response variable, even though any variable is good enough.

# Split up the sample, basically randomly assigns a booleans to a new column "sample"
sample <- sample.split(df$DonatedInMar07, SplitRatio = 0.70) # SplitRatio = percent of sample==TRUE

# Training Data
train = subset(df, sample == TRUE)

# Testing Data
test = subset(df, sample == FALSE)

# Test the Training and Test Data
str(train)
str(test)

# # Assign the Data as a Dataframe
# dfTrain <- train
# dfTest  <- test
# 
# ## Now that we confirmed the input data, write the data back to keep a backup file, before we do any operation.
# 
# ## Write the Backup CSV file 
# write.csv(dfTrain, file = "trainbackup.csv")
# write.csv(dfTest, file = "testbackup.csv")

## You can visit the directory and check 
```
